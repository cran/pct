# pct · [![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/ITSLeeds/pct/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/ITSLeeds/pct?branch=master) [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/ITSLeeds/pct.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ITSLeeds/pct)

The goal of pct is to increase the accessibility and reproducibility of
the data produced by the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), a research
project and web application hosted at
[www.pct.bike](https://www.pct.bike/). For an overview of the data
provided by the PCT, clicking on the previous link and trying it out is
a great place to start. An academic
[paper](https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/862) on the PCT
provides detail on the motivations for and methods underlying the
project.

A major motivation behind the project was making transport evidence more
accessible, encouraging evidence-based transport policies. The code base
underlying the PCT is publicly available (see
[github.com/npct](https://github.com/npct/)). However, the code hosted
there is not easy to run or reproduce, which is where this package comes
in: it provides quick access to the data underlying the PCT and enables
some of the key results to be reproduced quickly. It was developed
primarily for educational purposes (including for upcoming PCT training
courses) but it may be useful for people to build on the the methods,
for example to create a scenario of cycling uptake in their
town/city/region.

In summary, if you want to know how PCT works, be able to reproduce some
of its results, and build scenarios of cycling uptake to inform
transport policies enabling cycling in cities worldwide, this package is
for you\!

## Installation

You can install the development version of the package as
follows:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ITSLeeds/pct")
```

<!-- You can install the released version of pct from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("pct") -->

<!-- ``` -->

Load the package as follows:

``` r
library(pct)
```

### Get PCT data

From feedback, we hear that the use of the data is critical in decision
making. Therefore, one area where the package could be useful is making
the data “easily” available to be processed.

  - `get_pct`: the basic function to obtain data available [here]().

The rest of these should be self explanatory.

  - `get_pct_centroids`
  - `get_pct_lines`
  - `get_pct_rnet`
  - `get_pct_routes_fast`
  - `get_pct_routes_quiet`
  - `get_pct_zones`
  - `uptake_pct_godutch`
  - `uptake_pct_govtarget`

For example, to get the centroids in West Yorkshire:

``` r
centroids = get_pct_centroids(region = "west-yorkshire")
#> Loading required package: sp
plot(centroids[, "geo_name"])
```

<img src="man/figures/README-centroids-1.png" width="100%" />

Likewise to download the desire lines for “west-yorkshire”:

``` r
lines = get_pct_lines(region = "west-yorkshire")
lines = lines[order(lines$all, decreasing = TRUE), c("all")]
plot(lines[1:10,], lwd = 4)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-get_pct_lines-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r
# view the lines on a map
# mapview::mapview(lines[1:3000, c("geo_name1")])
```

## Reproduce PCT for Leeds

This example shows how scenarios of cycling uptake, and how ‘distance
decay’ works (short trips are more likely to be cycled than long trips).

The input data looks like this (origin-destination data and geographic
zone data):

``` r
class(od_leeds)
#> [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
od_leeds[c(1:3, 12)]

The `stplanr` package can be used to convert the non-geographic OD data
into geographic desire lines as follows:

``` r
library(sf)
#> Linking to GEOS 3.7.0, GDAL 2.4.0, PROJ 5.2.0
desire_lines = stplanr::od2line(flow = od_leeds, zones = zones_leeds[2])
#> Creating centroids representing desire line start and end points.
#> Warning in st_centroid.sf(zones): st_centroid assumes attributes are
#> constant over geometries of x
#> Warning in st_centroid.sfc(st_geometry(x), of_largest_polygon =
#> of_largest_polygon): st_centroid does not give correct centroids for
#> longitude/latitude data
plot(desire_lines[c(1:3, 12)])
```

<img src="man/figures/README-desire-1.png" width="100%" />

We can convert these straight lines into routes with a routing service,
e.g.:

``` r
routes_fast = stplanr::line2route(desire_lines, route_fun = stplanr::route_cyclestreet)
#> 10 % out of 10 distances calculated
#> 20 % out of 10 distances calculated
#> 30 % out of 10 distances calculated
#> 40 % out of 10 distances calculated
#> 50 % out of 10 distances calculated
#> 60 % out of 10 distances calculated
#> 70 % out of 10 distances calculated
#> 80 % out of 10 distances calculated
#> 90 % out of 10 distances calculated
#> 100 % out of 10 distances calculated
```

We got useful information from this routing operation. We will add the
desire line data onto vital data from the routes (from a cycling uptake
perspective, distance and hilliness of routes):

``` r
routes_vital = sf::st_sf(
  cbind(
  sf::st_drop_geometry(desire_lines[c(1:3, 12)]),
  sf::st_drop_geometry(routes_fast[c("length", "av_incline")]),
  geometry = routes_fast$geometry
  ))
plot(routes_vital)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="100%" />

Now we estimate cycling
uptake:

``` r
routes_vital$uptake = uptake_pct_govtarget(distance = routes_vital$length, gradient = routes_vital$av_incline)
#> Distance assumed in m, switching to km
routes_vital$bicycle_govtarget = routes_vital$bicycle +
  round(routes_vital$uptake * routes_vital$all)
```

Let’s see how many people started cycling:

``` r
sum(routes_vital$bicycle_govtarget) - sum(routes_vital$bicycle)
#> [1] 768
```

Nearly 1000 more people cycling to work, just in 10 desire is not bad\!
What % cycling is this, for those routes?

``` r
sum(routes_vital$bicycle_govtarget) / sum(routes_vital$all)
#> [1] 0.1153505
sum(routes_vital$bicycle) / sum(routes_vital$all)
#> [1] 0.03963324
```

It’s gone from 4% to 11%, a realistic increase if cycling were enabled
by good infrastructure and policies.

Now: where to prioritise that infrastructure and those
policies?

``` r
rnet = stplanr::overline2(routes_vital, attrib = c("bicycle", "bicycle_govtarget"))
lwd = rnet$bicycle_govtarget / mean(rnet$bicycle_govtarget)
plot(rnet["bicycle_govtarget"], lwd = lwd)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="100%" />

We can view the results in an interactive map and share with policy
makers, stakeholders, and the public\! E.g. (see interactive map
[here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/474074)):

``` r
mapview::mapview(rnet, zcol = "bicycle_govtarget", lwd = lwd * 2)
```

## Current limitations

  - This package currently does not estimate cycling uptake associated
    with intrazonal flows and people with no fixed job data.
  - This package currently does not estimate health benefits.

## Next steps and further resources (work in progress)

  - Add additional scenarios of cycling uptake from different places
    (e.g. goCambridge)
  - Add additional distance decay functions
  - Make it easy to use data from other cities around the world
  - Show how to create raster tiles of cycling uptake
